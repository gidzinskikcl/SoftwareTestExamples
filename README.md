# A Demonstration of Software Testing in Java

This simple project was created to demonstrate my approach to software testing in Java, utilising a variety of test cases and techniques.

This project includes:

- **Test Case/Suite Design:** A series of unit tests targeting specific functionality within the software, written using JUnit and Mockito.

  - **Note:** some tests fail on purpose in order to demonstrate how tests helped detecting faults in the software.

- **Fault Detection and Debugging: (to be continued)** A detailed analysis of potential software faults, their identification through tests, and explanations of how the issues were uncovered.

- **Coverage Analysis: (to be continued)** Generating test coverage to measure how much of the software has been tested and to highlight areas that may need additional attention (VSCode feature).

<u>**Below I explain the software system under test and the user requirements**</u>

## Brief Software Description

The Shopping Cart system is an online platform designed to provide a seamless purchasing experience. It allows users to browse products, add them to their cart, and accurately calculate the total cost. The system includes several discount mechanisms, such as tiered discounts based on cart value, customer-specific pricing (Regular, Premium, or VIP), and bundle discounts for certain product combinations. Additionally, it supports time-limited promotions and coupon codes for extra savings.
