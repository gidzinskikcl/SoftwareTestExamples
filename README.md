# SoftwareTestExamples
This simple project was created to demonstrate my approach to software testing, utilizing a variety of test cases and techniques. It shows how I test software systems, identify defects, and ensure functionality through systematic test case creation.

This project includes:

- **Test Case Design:** A series of unit tests targeting specific functionality within the software, written using JUnit and Mockito for Java.

- **Test Suite Organization:** Grouping related test cases into test suites for efficient execution and coverage analysis.

- **Fault Detection and Debugging:** A detailed analysis of potential software faults, their identification through tests, and explanations of how the issues were uncovered.

- **Test Reporting:** A comprehensive report discussing testing approaches, challenges faced during testing, trade-offs made in test design, and a summary of defects found.

- **Coverage Analysis:** Generation of a test coverage report to measure how much of the software has been tested and to highlight areas that may need additional attention (VSCode).
